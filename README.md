# Amazon Clone Project

## Description:
This project is a simple HTML and CSS clone of the Amazon website's main page. It aims to replicate the layout and design of the Amazon homepage using only HTML and CSS.

## Features:
- Static design: The page layout is static and does not adjust based on screen size.
- Flexbox layout: The page layout is created using the CSS flexbox property rather than a grid layout.
- Placeholder links: Links and interactive elements on the page are placeholders and do not have actual functionality.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-clone.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd amazon-clone`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the Amazon clone page.

## Usage:
- The page does not have functional navigation links or interactive elements.
- Placeholder links and interactive elements are included for demonstration purposes only.
- The design is static and does not respond to different screen sizes.
